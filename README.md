# Density based clustering algorithm

## Introduction
DB scan algorithm is a density-based clustering algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away)

## Input
There is a text file containing x and y values in the format | x y |. [Link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Density_based_clustering_algorithm/blob/master/data.txt). Run-time input to the program are **Min-points** to cluster and **epsilon value**.

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
